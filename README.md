# Yeasti

Yeasti is a responsive web application designed to help restaurants manage and display their product menus. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), Yeasti provides a seamless user experience with multi-level authentication, live search, and dynamic menu management.

## Getting Started

First, download the libraries:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `app/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Features

- Multi-level Authentication: Secure access for restaurant owners and employees.
- Dynamic Menu Management: Add, edit, delete, and reorder menu items with drag-and-drop functionality.
- Live Search: Efficiently search products with real-time updates.
- QR Code Generation: Create QR codes linking to the restaurantâ€™s personalized menu.
- Printable Menus: Generate printable PDF versions of the menu.
